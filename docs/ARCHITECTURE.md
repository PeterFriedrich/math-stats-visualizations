# Architecture

## 1. Shape

A static site with no build step and no dependencies. ES modules are served
as-is from `site/`, so GitHub Pages (or any static host) can publish the folder
directly, and tests import the same files the browser runs. The apparatus is
copied from chemistry_sim (itself copied from physics_sim); it replaced a PyQt6
desktop app on 2026-10-01.

```

└── js/
    ├── catalog.js        courses, units, sims — the single list
    ├── home.js           home page renderer
    ├── sim-page.js       loads js/sims/<id>.js into sim.html
    ├── maths/            pure functions, seeded randomness, no DOM   ← tested
    ├── lib/              canvas, controls, clock, format
    └── sims/             one module per simulation: UI + drawing only
tests/                    node:test — stats, format, catalog, repo invariants
tools/                    serve.js (dev server), verify-sims.js (browser smoke test)
scripts/                  Python guards from the workflow template (stdlib only)
```

## 2. Layers and what each may do

| Layer | May | May not |
|---|---|---|
| `maths/` | maths, counting, random draws from a passed-in `rng` | touch the DOM, format numbers, know about pixels, call `Math.random()` |
| `lib/` | DOM, canvas, formatting | contain statistics or counting formulas |
| `sims/` | wire controls → maths → drawing | compute a readout without a `maths/` function |
| `catalog.js` | list sims and units | import sim modules |

The rule that matters: **a number on screen traces to a tested `maths/`
function.** Rendering code can be wrong-looking; it cannot be wrong-valued.

## 3. The sim page contract

`sim-page.js` imports `js/sims/<id>.js` and expects:

- `equations`: `[{ html, what }]` — shown under "Key equations".
- `prompts`: `[html]` — shown under "Try this" (at least three).
- `legend` (optional): `[{ color, label }]`, `color` naming a `--c-*` token.
- `tallOnMobile` (optional): `true` gives the canvas a portrait aspect on phones
  for sims that stack two views.
- `mount(ui)`: builds the sim into `ui = { canvas, controls, readouts, transport, steps }`.
  `steps` is a panel under the canvas, hidden unless the sim sets
  `ui.steps.hidden = false` and fills it; `complete-square` uses it for its
  worked steps, which need HTML (stacked fractions) the canvas cannot draw.

`tests/catalog.test.js` checks every catalog entry against this contract, and
that no module in `sims/` is missing from the catalog.

A catalog entry names one `course` and `unit`, and may list more in `also`
(`[{ course, unit }]`). The counting sims use it to appear under both
Mathematics 30-1 and 30-2; the home page and the sim page badge read
`placements()`. A sim with nothing to animate still creates the clock for its
redraw loop and hides the transport bar.

## 4. Time, randomness and drawing

`lib/clock.js` runs one `requestAnimationFrame` loop per page. Simulated time
advances only while playing (times the speed setting); the frame callback runs
every frame regardless, so a paused sim still redraws when a slider moves.
Sims read control values each frame rather than keeping derived state, except
where a change must restart the run (`onChange` → reset).

The physics and chemistry sites treat random motion as decoration that feeds no
readout. Here sampling is often the subject, so the rule is different:

- **Exact where a formula exists.** Counting, probability and expected values
  come from closed-form `maths/` functions, so they equal the hand calculation.
- **Simulated readouts are labelled and reproducible.** A readout that averages
  random draws says "simulated", comes from `maths/random.js` seeded with the
  seed shown on screen, and sits beside its exact value where one exists.
- **A run depends on the seed, not on frame timing.** A sim draws "sample
  number k" from the generator in order, so the first 1 000 samples are the
  same at any speed or frame rate.

## 5. Theming

Colours are CSS custom properties on `:root`, redefined for dark mode.
`lib/canvas.js` `theme()` reads them so canvas drawing follows the page theme.
Colour meanings are shared across sims so students learn one code:
`--c-param` is a population parameter (the true value), `--c-stat` a sample
statistic (what the data gave); `--c-series-a`/`-b` are plain data series;
`--c-danger` is the error box and warnings.

## 6. Verification and deployment

- **Merge gate (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)**: `node --test` plus the two
  Python doc guards. Offline, secret-free, dependency-free, so it cannot flake
  on an upstream outage and never gets ignored.
- **Browser smoke test (`tools/verify-sims.js`)**: headless Chromium over every
  page. Not on the gate — it needs a browser download there — so it is run
  locally before merging UI work (`npm run verify`). If UI regressions start
  slipping through, promote it to its own CI job rather than weakening it.
- **Deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**: on push to `main`, re-runs the
  unit tests, builds `site/` into `_site/` with `tools/build-site.js`, and
  publishes that to GitHub Pages. One-time setup: repository Settings → Pages →
  Source: *GitHub Actions*.
- **Cache busting (`tools/build-site.js`)**: Pages lets browsers cache every
  file for 10 minutes, so right after a deploy a fresh page could run against an
  old `catalog.js` ("the new sim isn't there"). The build stamps the stylesheet
  and entry scripts with `?v=<content hash>` and writes an import map into each
  HTML page that sends every module, including the sim page's dynamic import,
  to its hashed URL. `site/` stays unbuilt for local work (`npm run serve`);
  `npm run verify:built` checks the built output and fails on any unversioned
  `.js`/`.css` request.
- The workflow guards stay in Python (stdlib only, no `pip install`) as they
  came from the template.

## 7. Teaching models (deliberate simplifications)

Each is stated in the code where it lives and flagged to the student where it
could mislead.

- **Bessel's correction** (`maths/variance.js`, `sims/bessel.js`): samples are
  drawn straight from a normal population N(μ, σ²). The PyQt version drew
  100 000 normal values first and resampled from them; that finite population
  had its own variance, slightly off σ², so the "true σ²" line was not exactly
  the target. The expected values (σ²(n − 1)/n and σ²) hold for any population
  with variance σ²; the normal is only what the sim draws from. The histogram
  axis spans 4 standard deviations of s² (σ²√(2/(n − 1)), a normal-population
  result) either side of σ², floored at 0; estimates beyond it are counted in
  the averages and reported as "beyond the axis". Both panels share one count
  scale. The run stops at 50 000 samples.
- **Counting principle** (`maths/counting.js` `product`, `sims/counting.js`):
  independent choices only — the options at one step never depend on an
  earlier choice — with up to 4 choices of up to 6 options. The tree draws as
  many levels as stay readable and states the rest as "× n".
- **Permutations** (`sims/permutations.js`): objects in a row only (no circular
  arrangements, no objects kept together or apart). Up to 9 objects; a word of
  up to 12 letters A–Z, other characters dropped. Arrangements are listed when
  there are 400 or fewer, cut to what fits with "… and N more".
- **Combinations** (`sims/combinations.js`): up to 12 objects. The committee
  mode has two groups and one condition, on the number taken from the second
  group; every possible split is a case, and the cases that fit are added.
- **Binomial theorem** (`sims/binomial.js`): (ax + by)<sup>n</sup> with whole
  a and b from −5 to 5 and n up to 10. Linear terms only: no x² or 1/x inside
  the bracket, which is where the 30-1 bulletin says students struggle.
- **Odds** (`maths/probability.js`, `sims/odds.js`): equally likely outcomes,
  up to 20 favourable and 20 unfavourable. Odds print in lowest terms, so
  0 favourable to 5 unfavourable prints 0 : 1.
- **Venn diagram** (`sims/venn.js`): two events. The circles are a fixed size,
  drawn overlapping or apart; areas are not to scale, and the counts in the
  regions carry the sizes. Counts that cannot happen are refused with the
  reason, not clamped.
- **Tree diagram** (`sims/tree.js`): two draws from a bag of two colours, each
  marble equally likely. Branch and path fractions are left unreduced so they
  match the student's working (3/8 × 2/7 = 6/56); the readouts reduce them.
- **Completing the square** (`maths/quadratic.js`, `sims/complete-square.js`):
  whole-number a (−5 to 5, not 0), b and c (−20 to 20), so every step is an
  exact fraction. The area model shows the bracket x² + kx (k = b ÷ a); the
  side x is drawn at an arbitrary length because x is unknown, and the strip
  width is scaled to h = k ÷ 2, clamped so a strip stays visible and on the
  canvas. A negative k is drawn as area taken away: two strips overlap in a
  corner that is taken twice, so h² is added back. Steps after the current one
  stay hidden, and the vertex readouts and graph marks appear only at the last
  step, so a student can work ahead on paper.
- **Applied quadratics** (`maths/quadratic.js` `linearProduct`,
  `sims/linear-product.js`): three fixed problem types, each a product of two
  lines with non-zero slopes. The rectangle's sides are the two factors, scaled
  to the largest value each reaches on the x slider; revenue uses a separate
  scale for each side (dollars against tickets), the two area problems one
  scale. The vertex is found as the midpoint of the zeros, not by completing
  the square. The domain is where both factors are non-negative; the path
  problem opens up, so its domain is x ≥ 0 and its question is answered by
  solving for a given path area instead of reading the vertex. x may be any
  value on the slider, including ones outside the domain, which the picture
  refuses with the reason. The zeros, vertex and domain appear only at the
  last step.
